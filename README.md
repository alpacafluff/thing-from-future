# thing-from-future
 The Thing from the Future (2014) is originally a physical card playing game created by Stuart Candy and Jeff Watson (Situation Lab). Visit their site [here]( https://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/)
 
This little project I made to dust off my basic web development skills. I used the [p5js](p5js.org) library for the interactivity. Feel free to reuse any of this and let me know how it can be improved (the js is painfully rustic, sorry, still getting the hang of it).
